# The Brief for Week 2

Your brief this week is to use what Eskil and Maria showed you:  
**Use Javascript to display some type of data on your webpage.**

Pick a *dataset* that you find interesting, for example: Favorite movies.

You should:
* Create a new simple HTML page.
* Create a javascript array or object that has this data.
* Create some javascript that will display the information in the HTML.
* Make it available online so that you can share a link to it.

Bonus:
* Can you allow the visitor of the webpage to change or add data?
* Make it pretty/nice
* Can you get your data from an API?

More:
* *Coding Buddies, groups of 3 people.*. This will be your support team this week. Check in with your two coding buddies, how you are progressing. Make sure to help eachother.
* Do a presentation and a code review with your coding buddies. 
Your presentation:
    1. Show off and present what you built
    2. Go through the code and explain how it works and what your biggest struggle was and how you solved it.
* Send me a short version of your presentation:
    1. A link to your project.
    2. What it is.
    3. Short summary how you made it work and was your biggest struggle / how you solved it.
